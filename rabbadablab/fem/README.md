# THIS PROJECT DOES NOT INTEND TO BASH FEMINISM.
It was started to poke fun at Ms. Monopoly, being a game targeting women it seems? Didn't come off too well, cared more for making money instead of actually supporting anything worthwile.
Then this turned into more of an actual game, but still with the ironic Ms. Monopoly theme.
Again, making fun of a soulless corporate idea of feminism, not feminism itself.
Feminism today is as important as it ever was, and it would be wrong to disregard it in any way.
If anything is problematic please let me know!

tl;dr feminism good, soulless corporate "feminism" bad
