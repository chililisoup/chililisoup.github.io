A site compilation of all of my JavaScript projects. (And python projects but not really)



Pong is just a simple pong game with adjustable paddle speeds. Simple collisions and a simple bot to play with.
100% complete.



Slash code is an encrypting/decrypting application that converts letters into their Slash Code counterparts.
100% complete. Rewritten in 2021



Action is a random sentence generator that follows a set order.
Pretty much complete. Just adding more words/phrases.
Rewritten in 2021. May add more words now that it's easier since the rewrite



Web MIDI was an attempt to make an in browser MIDI player/editor.
It is currently used to host a couple wheel deciders for compositional challenges.
May revisit the idea in the future.



Art is just a simple drawing program I ~~am~~ was making to get better at using the canvas element.



Physics 2D is a simple physics simulation ran using Matter JS (http://brm.io/matter-js/)



Tetris is a modified version of Cezary Tomczak's JS tetris, adding many features, such as tetromino storing and customizable skins.



Python Projects is a currently out of date python script made up of my python scripts, ran on an external site.



Jef Jump is a Geometry Dash/Impossible Game style test



Jef Defense is a tower defense test



UwU translator translates your text into "UwU speak"
100% complete



Circles allows you to make procedural art using spinning circles attached to each other at points
May add a generator that turns a user inputted stroke into a series of circles



MC Biome Gen will be a tool to aid in making custom biomes for Minecraft datapacks in 1.17
Will probably finish once 1.17 is released.



Life is a Game of Life simulation with many features, like custom rules and saving/loading.
Current algorithm is basic, an object with locations stored as key names is iterated through.
I plan to implement the hashlife algorithm, and make the front end better.

Rabbadablab is very good!

Jef clicker is even better!
